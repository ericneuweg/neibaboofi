I downloaded BOFIII from the eu psn store and upon booting the game I'm greeted with the old 'Insufficient space on memory stick duo, game requires 192kb of free space to save data' plagued from the original psp game for having a memory card over 2GB. The fix for this for the original psp was to download a gamefaqs save and overwrite your save through the PC. The problem lies within the Vitas folder structure, it wont simply read gamefaq saves because it cant see them. The real solution would. So the other day the Octopath Traveller box art was revealed and what a beautiful piece of art that was. If I somehow knew nothing of the game and saw that box art in a store I'd most likely google the game immediately. That's just a testament to appealing the art is, it gets me interested in the game as soon as I see it. This led me to think of other games that grabbed my interested through their beautiful box art. Golden Sun (actually the full picture which was then cropped for the square. I am thinking about buying Breath of Fire 3 on my vita, but I am not sure whether it ported well?

Please remember that all of this is IMO only: Breath of Fire 1 (Snes version) : Original version or Breath of Fire 1 (GBA version) : Increased xp/loot, change in color pallete(bad thing), music went from stereo to mono(bad thing), interface and character portraits were changed(good thing)?

I’m hitting you lovely people with yet another overlong review. Alas, I have no spoofy prologue to grace you with this time around. (I briefly considered writing this in the style of Cervantes — because, you know, Spanish maison — but then I remembered that Don Q is considered by many to be the greatest literary work ever written, meanwhile I employ parenthetical run-on sentences with the frequency of a pretentious 11th grader. Review dreams deferred.)

It's been a while since I've posted, or interacted on here for that matter, as life gets in the way sometimes but as always I am still looking to trade off some of my collection for other things.

I've spent the last month making bubbles for Adrenaline Bubbles Manager. My PS1 set is finished. The art was all gathered from the internet - I don't claim any of it as mine. All I did was find it and crop it, with some photoshopping where needed. PSP is next. amp#x200B; Zippyshare Link (https://www71.zippyshare.com/v/UvmsS2ub/file.html) amp#x200B; Game List: Adventures of Little Ralph Adventures of Lomax Alundra Blasto Blood Omen - Legacy.

Everything will be tested before I ship, but I believe everything to be working as of right now. Exceptions are GB, NES, and dreamcast games that I cannot test. I threw together the price list with pretty little research, so changes might be made as I go along and don't be afraid to make offers. Some might have stickers or minor defects on the box or game.

I just did my second huge TB order and I placed an order for a Marmont with Darcy, so I'm waiting with baited breath for payments to clear and PSPs to arrive. I NEED A DISTRACTION! So, here is a little haul of some cute branded and unbranded accessories I purchased from AliExpress. I know, I know, it's not everyone's favorite but laaaawd it's easy and I've generally had amazing luck. So kick back, help distract me from checking my phone every five seconds about my new babies, and enjoy. I'm in the process of trying to trim down all of my games, books, and movies for a multitude of reasons. I was hoping that this subreddit could help me make the tough decision of what to keep and what I should get rid of for my PSP collection. I have already eliminated 15 - 20 games, but I've hit a wall of sentimentality. I'm trying to trim down to the 20 - 30 range for all of my consoles at most. amp#x200B; Let me know what you'd keep or what you'd dump. Thanks for the help! amp#x200B;.
