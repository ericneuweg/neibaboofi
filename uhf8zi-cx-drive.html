                            <p> I'm considering buying either a Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4 or a similar small to mid-sized SUV. I would buy a used car (maybe around a 2016?). I'm open to other makes of small to mid-sized SUV as well. I'm also considering a hybrid option. I'm mid thirties, female if it matters. I don't want to spend too much money because I may possibly relocate to another country in the next few years (but undecided currently). I want something safe and reliable. I really don't care about what car I drive It's my first time looking for a new car (my others have been hand-me-downs), and I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out what to decide on. For context, I'm from Canada, trying to keep pricing as close to 30,000 as possible, and only looking at small-sized SUVs. Trying to keep things in the 2018-2019 range. The main things I'm looking for: Gotta be fun to drive/have decent acceleration (I know I know, "fun" and SUV don't go together at this price range. But I'm still wanting somethi. 
I own a 2009 VW Tiguan with almost 90k miles on it. It’s now coming to an end. I was wondering what yalls opinion was on whether or not I should get another VW and do a trade-in or if I should just get another make? And if so. Which ones? My budget is about k, I can put a down payment of k and can afford about a 5/monthly. I’m just really frustrated with everything I’ve been through with this car. I’ve had almost every possible VW horror story possible. Issues like: - Sunroof I need to get a new car within the next year. I currently have an '06 Rav4. Great for transporting large objects like chairs/tables/paintings amp ski equipment in the winter. Need AWD for sure with where I live Prefer not a super compact sedan. I don't mind a regular sedan so long as it has ample trunk space - need to fit furniture at times!My current mpg is about 22 so I'd like to stick around that or more fuel efficient. Would love to have HUD, heated amp power leather seats My current car is beginning to go and I am starting the process of looking for its replacement and spend about 15k. I'm specifically looking for: 15k price point AWD (FWD amp snow tires will not do. Got stuck last year on my commute home with this setup. Need to be at work regardless of weather) Comfortable, solid feeling ride (CRV's in my budget feel like a tin can to me) Would like to hold onto car for ~8 years or so the newer we can get it and the more reliable it'll The 2020 Mazda CX-30 was just unveiled in Geneva, what are your thoughts? It's supposed to slot between the CX-3 and CX-5. https://i.redd.it/sk4s2yapmak21.jpg Picture is from Mazda UK's Twitter. amp#x200B; Link to livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihgQLrNwDfc (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihgQLrNwDfc). For a while, I’ve been looking for the right car to replace my beater 2003 Accord since my life has changed a lot since I’ve got it (kids, house, daily commuting to a city for work). I’ve been looking for a much safer car, AWD, Apple CarPlay, and a bit more utility. I’ve been looking at crossovers, but they’ve been awfully slow, poor handling, and felt very cheap amp uncomfortable. My top choices so far are the Subaru Impreza Hatchback and the VW Alltrack, but I’ve got some issues with both. I’m taking a new job that requires me to buy a decent car, with an allowance of 0/month. I had been looking at the new forester/CX-5/Rav 4, but I think I’d rather go a bit up market which puts me now at: BMW X1 Volvo XC40 Audi Q3 I’m looking for something I’m not going to ruin if I go off-road, I do a bit of camping and hunting and whatever I buy will be going down some forestry roads in its life. After that my next requirement is interior comfort, and then sportiness - I will be doing. I'm currently leasing a 2017 Nissan Rouge and the lease will be up March 2020. I know I'm thinking a bit ahead here but the thing is I've had my eye on the CX-5 for quite some time now and I've specifically become interested in the GT Reserve. At first I was considering leasing it but now I'm seriously considering buying it. If I end up deciding to buy I want to start socking away for a good down payment, hence my thinking ahead. amp#x200B; Since this trim is fairly new though, I'm wondering. I'm looking to buy a used CX9 around 2016-2017. I currently drive a CX5, everything is perfect apart from driving through the potholes in NY and I need a bigger car for the family. amp#x200B; I test drove a highlander 2016 and a 2017 CX9. CX9 suspension was a little harder but the handling was no doubt better. I'm a little puzzled why it felt quicker than the highlander when the engine is 2.5L turbo (227bhp) vs 3.5L (270bhp)? amp#x200B; I'm still shopping around and want to try the Merce. 
Background: We have a two bay auto-repair garage, which shares a building with a small auto-parts store, in a small rural town. We get along great with next door, which is actually run by women, and pretty much only hires women for the last few generations(one grandson working through high school). the garage has a full uniform in dark blue with the company name and employee name in white. the auto-parts store is generally a t-shirt with their name in a variety of colours, it's a really small. Hello Reddit. I am currently driving a 2017 Ford Focus ST2. My commute has gone from 6 miles a day to 26 miles each way, and we have about 5 months of winter here. I'm looking to replace it with a small SUV.something in the RAv4, CR-V, Rogue, CX-5, Forester space, with AWD. From everything I've read, in that group, the CR-V is the most reliable and most feature rich for the money, however the CX-5 is a close second, and is more fun to drive. I've also read that the Forester's Hey Guys! Bought my wife an 18 mazda 3 gt hatch that is just incredible. (if only it had 50 more hp). I'm now a believer in the brand. I'm getting ready to replace my '16 tiguan. When I bought it, I compromised a bit and am hoping to do better this time. I really want a reasonably powerful, fun to drive car. But I also need capacity for the occasional road trip or costco run. The wife's 3 doesn't quite cut it in that regard. A good sound system is important but I could always I'm between leasing a 2019 Cherokee Limited trim and a 2019 Mazda CX-5 Touring trim.

 TTL and 0 a month. On the CX-5 it would be 00 down, 0 TLL and 0 month (both 36 months, 12k miles a year). That's a 00 difference.are there enough drawbacks to the Cherokee / difference between the two that would rationalize the 00 premium What do you guys think? I’m looking to replace my GTI and actually would like more space. I have a weekend car so don’t really need lot of power. Test drove one the other day and it rode really nice. Almost luxury like ride. Not as quiet as maybe our previous X5 but definitely impressed for the cost. Looking at a RAV4 and cx-5 today. But I do like Subaru’s capable awd system. I got camping a lot and it does snow a bit in Ohio. Most of the complaints seem to be the lack of an XT model Hello, I have been looking and test driving cars and I came to a conclusion that I will choose between: 2017/18/19 Honda CR-V EX-L or 2018/19 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring or 2018/19 Volkswagen Tiguan SE. amp#x200B; I have very hard time choosing between these 3 cars as both have pros and cons. I heard these from my friends: \-gt Mazda CX-5 breaks down very easily, pain in the ass. \-gt Honda CR-V is dull as shit and is boring. \-gt Volkswagen depreciates
